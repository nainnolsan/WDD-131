			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>
				The purpose of this website is to showcase my personal brand, technical skills, and development projects as a Computer Science student. It will serve as an online portfolio where employers, recruiters, and collaborators can learn more about who I am and what I can do.
			</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
				This site is designed for potential employers, internship recruiters, classmates, and collaborators who are looking to evaluate my skills and development experience. The audience includes individuals interested in junior developers, student projects, and real-world technical work.
			</p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
				This website will use JavaScript to dynamically load my projects from a modular data file. It will display project cards using arrays and objects, allow filtering and sorting using array methods such as filter(), map(), and forEach(), and update the DOM in response to user interactions. ES modules will be used to keep the code organized. Conditional logic will be used to toggle themes, validate forms, and react to user events like button clicks.
